1. Recognition: Deciding if an object is same as another
2. Discrimination: Deciding if an object is **distinct** from another object
3. Classification: Deciding what kind of object something is
4. Clustering: Deciding how to group some objects together


From an ontological POV, 1 is easiest and 4 is hardest
