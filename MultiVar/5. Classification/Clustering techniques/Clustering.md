Many different methods exist. We cover [[K-means]] and [[DBSCAN]]


Clustering is unsupervised! We only use a definition of "closeness".


## Why?
We can group samples into a few discrete groups, then make models on each group to understand similarities and differences.



## Types
Different types based on:

1. Connectivity
2. Density
3. Centroid
4. Distribution
5.

## Notes
Consult the table above before choosing anything
Never just use 1! 2 or even better 3 is good to test performance and explore the data!
