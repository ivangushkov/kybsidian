# Concept
How to separate effects that overlap in the sensor readings?

Ex: The peak of a changes with b and vice versa.

However, if the change in "a" is systematic, then we can still estimate the peak of "b" without the influence of "a"!


	We can make predictions about data from some variables that have  
    other sources of variation embedded from another variable, as long 
    as that variation is systematic



Methods to do this include [[PCR]] and [[PLSR]]
