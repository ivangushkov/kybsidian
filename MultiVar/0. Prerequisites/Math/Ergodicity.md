The average behavior over time of a trajectory does not depend on that particular trajectory that we are seeing


That is, [[Statistic]]s made on one dataset should reflect the ensamble statistics for an ergodic system.

	Non-stationarity implies non-ergodicity
	
	We can generally not test for ergodicity! I.e. the next sample may 
    always be a complete surprise!



Ergodicity + stationarity means that it is meaningful to do data-driven estimates.
