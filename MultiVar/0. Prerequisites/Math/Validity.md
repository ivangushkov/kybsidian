# Internal
Does the model include all inportant inputs that affect the output?
I.e. does our model actually model all important input-output relations?

# External
Are the results produced by the model generalizable to other situations or groups (i.e. different inputs).


Both types of validity can be tested for using a smart [[Splitting of datasets]] together with [[Model Validation]]
