Scipy! Gradient descent etc.

Drawback: We may be discarding structure in objective functions that can be used to solve the problems in a more computationally efficient way.

Sometimes it is preferable to have approximate analytical solutions instead of numerical ones, like when you have computational constraints, and analytical solutions are pretty much lookup tables!

However, numerical optimization is good in cases where even approximate analytical solutions are hard to find!
