Applies to the variance of the distribution of a random variable.


## Homoskedacity
The variance in a timeseries has constant parameters. That is, a time average will give you the same information about the statistical properties as an ensemble run

## Heteroskedacity
Variance changes over time, meaning we need an ensemble run to determine statistical properties
