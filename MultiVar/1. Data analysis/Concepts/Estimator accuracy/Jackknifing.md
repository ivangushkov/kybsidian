1. From the original dataset, obtain n datasets, each by removing one **sample**

2. Perform n estimates

3. Study the statistics of the n estimates, like sample mean and sample variance for each coefficient


Step 1 is like [[Cross validation]] if the fold size is 1
Step 2 and 3 is identical to [[Bootstrapping]]



Intuition: Stab the dataset horizontally with a knife to obtain datasets with "holes".
