1. From the original dataset, obtain n datasets by random sampling with replacement
2. Perform n estimates
3. Study the statistics of the estimates like sample mean and variance for each coefficient


Step 2 and 3 is identical to [[Jackknifing]]

Bootstrapping "explores" more of the space around the "true" dataset in the domain it lives in, since we are not just removing 1 variable at a time. However, we do not wish to move too far away!
