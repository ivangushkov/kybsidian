# Variance
	The variance of the estimator: How sensitive the model is to 
    variations in the data

y contains noise with fixed variance. y_hat is a deterministic transformation of the data. Since the data is a random vector, y_hat is a random variable. The more complex the map y_hat = f(y) is, the more the noise in y is **amplified**

Thus: When overfitting ([[Over and Underfitting]]), we increase variance!
