	The expected deviation between y_hat and y.
	
High bias means that the deviation is large, and vice versa.

Geometrically: The true theta exists in some hypothesis space. 
The kicker here is that we **DO NOT** know what the true theta is. However, the higher the complexity of our model, the more degrees of freedom we have to "get closer" in some sense to the true theta.

Thus, by increasing model order complexity lowers bias.
