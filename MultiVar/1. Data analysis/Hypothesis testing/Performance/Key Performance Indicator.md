The error probabilities of a [[Statistical test]] g:

Ex: alpha0 is the probability of selecting any other hypothesis given that 0 is true.

g is the map from data to hypotheses

Each test will have different error rates for all the i's, and the performance depends on the domain we are applying our test to.

The [[Uniformly most powerful test]] is a method of fixing the error probability of one alpha, then minimizing all other errors, or the test that has the lowest specified alpha given all the other alphas
