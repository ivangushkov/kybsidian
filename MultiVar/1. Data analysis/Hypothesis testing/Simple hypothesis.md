An hypothesis that specifies all the parameters of the assumingly true probability distribution.

	We specify the numbers involved in the PDF, i.e. mean and var for 
    the gaussian case

The assumption about the true probability can be reduced to a point in the space of probability distributions, unlike the [[Composite hypotheses]]
