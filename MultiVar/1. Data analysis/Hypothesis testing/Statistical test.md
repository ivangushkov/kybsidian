Statistical test for testing between [[Simple hypothesis]]: Any measurable map from the measurement to the hypotheses.

Graphically, the data is distributed in some space. A test takes this space of data and partitions it into the different hypotheses.

	Different partitionings yield different tests!


Different test yield different [[Key Performance Indicator]]s. Common test:
* [[Uniformly most powerful test]]
* [[Bayes test]]
* [[Minimum and nonminimum phase]]


We can view g as a set of all tests, and specifying some alphas yields a subset of this.



## Designing tests 
We should center tests where the given hypotheses "make the data appear".
