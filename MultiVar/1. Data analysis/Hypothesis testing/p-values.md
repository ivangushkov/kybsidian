Used for [[Statistical test]]s


Concept: I define a probability, say 5%, and "allocate" that so that it defines my [[Events]].
That is, we define "what is luck and what is actual event".


The p-value captures the probability of obtaining some [[Statistic]] is at least as extreme as what actually observed, given that the null hypothesis is correct.


If a realization is **under** the p-value we choose, then we "admit" that the probability of H0 being wrong is a better claim than that the realization was "lucky"!

* Significant result: A result that makes me reject H0
* Statistical significance of a test: Probability of making a mistake

Notes:

	A conclusion does not become *immediatly* true when passing the 
    threshold!

	Be skeptical when you see p-values
