* Which model structure is the best?
	* [[Model Order Selection]]
* Which parameters are best for the model structure?
	* [[Least squares]]
	* [[maximum likelihood estimation]]
	* [[maximum a posteriori estimation]]
* Which performance will the estimator have if deployed in real-world-situations?
	* [[Model Validation]] and [[Performance indices]]

To answer these, we need to split our data: [[Splitting of datasets]]

Training: Theta hat
Testing: [[Model Order Selection]]
Validation: [[Model Validation]]
