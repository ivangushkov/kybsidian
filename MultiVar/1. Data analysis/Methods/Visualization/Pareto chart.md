Two critical limits:
1. t- limit: based on a t-test
2. Bonferroni limit: a conservative limit taking into account the number of terms in the model.

Effects above 2. are almost certainly important and should thus be left in the model

Effects that are above 1. are possibly important and should be added only if they make sense to "us"

Effects below 1. should only be selected to "support hierarchy"
