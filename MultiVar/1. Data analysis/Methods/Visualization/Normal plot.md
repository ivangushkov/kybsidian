## Concept
If there are no significant effects, the responses should follow a normal distribution.

## Normal plot
Take all effects and make distribution plots. Then take the CDF for each one. Calculate the log around the mean of the CDF and plot in a log plot.

The CDF wil be heavier on one side or the other if there is an effect that is outside of just random variation.

	Effects that deviate from a straight line may be significant

Plotting as is is the "normal plot" while the absolute value is half-normal
