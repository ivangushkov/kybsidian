Much like [[Full factorial design]], but we wish to reduce the amount of experiments. 

To do this, we neglect some of the higher order terms:

	The main effects are aliased/confounded with interaction effects
	

## Example
3 Design variables, but we wish to reduce the higher order variations. We do this by C = AB. This leaves us to make 2^(3 - 1) runs:

If we see the design space from all angles head on, we still span all four corners.

Setting (C = AB) means that we remove a degree of freedom when creating the high/low table, that is, C is fully determined by A and B

## Confounding
The "price" we pay for not doing [[Full factorial design]], i.e. that some effects cannot be studied independently of one another.

The degree of confounding is described by the *confounding pattern*, and the *resolution*.
