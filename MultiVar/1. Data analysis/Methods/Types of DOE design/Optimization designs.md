The objective is to model the [[Response surface]] with **accuracy** so as to know the shape of the response surface and from this find optimal values.

The model terms include
* Main effects
* Interactions
* Squared and/or cubic terms

## Design types
* [[Central composite design]]
* Box-Behnken designs
* Optimal designs (for constraints or to minimize # of runs)


		With a two-level design with center points, we cannot estimate individual pure quadratic effects, just detect that there *are* nonlinear effects.
