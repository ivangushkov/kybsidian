The loadings is a measure of "how much of each score to use to represent a specific PC".

The loadings can be plotted and may show correlations between the variables.


The closer to the origin a variable is in the loadings plot, the less it contributes overall, and thus make it a candidate for reduction

Loadings can be overlaid with [[Scores]] to give an indication of which variables contribute to which sample grouping.

Loadings are orthonormal. Thus, the values will depend on the number of variables!!!

	It is not possible to give a rule of thumb for critical values for a 
    loading to be important


The loadings are not necessarily uncorrelated!


## Correlation loadings
[[Correlation]] loadings plot shows the sqrt explained variance (range 0-1) for each PC plus circular thresholds
