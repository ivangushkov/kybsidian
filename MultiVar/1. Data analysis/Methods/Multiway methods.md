# Upping dimensionality
For any data that is not in 2D, i.e. not a 2D matrix of variable vs sample, but something in higher dimension.

# Approaches
We may deploy unfolding to reduce the higher order data set to 2D and do normal analysis like [[PCA]] or [[ICA]].

Another approach is an **N-way model**, that is extensions of normal 2D/2 way models that are more robust, interpretable etc.

[[PCA]] becomes [[PARAFAC]] or [[Tucker3]]
[[PLSR]] becomes [[N-way PLSR]]
