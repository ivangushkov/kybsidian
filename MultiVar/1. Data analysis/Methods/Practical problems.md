Interesting features
* Data is subjective!

Missing data
* We may require algorithms that can automatically do [[Data imputaion]]

Data validity
* Some data is labelled incorrectly: We need to make sense of the results.
* Outliers: We may need to preprocess data.

		Adding more variables may turn what seemed to be an outlier into 
        an inlier!
