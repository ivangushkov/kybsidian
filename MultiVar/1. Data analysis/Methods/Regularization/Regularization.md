Try to penalize your estimates by introducing bias (to reduce variance), i.e. [[Bias variance tradeoff]]

The lambda in regularization requires tuning also, meaning that the normal [[Splitting of datasets]] has an additional hyperparameter to select for!

# Types
[[Ridge regularization]]

[[Lasso regularization]]

[[Elastic-net regularization]]
