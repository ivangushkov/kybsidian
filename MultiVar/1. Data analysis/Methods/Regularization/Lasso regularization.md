Add an absolute value cost to the [[Least squares]] / [[MLR]] estimate (L1 norm)
for the [[Bias variance tradeoff]]

This will have an added effect over [[Ridge regularization]] where it will take one of the variables to zero!

This then promotes parsimonity!!!

The more we punish, the more parameters go to zero
