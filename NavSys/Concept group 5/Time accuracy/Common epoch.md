Even though the satellites are all [[Time reference]] synchronized, the probability of all satellite signals reaching a user at the same exact time is essentially zero. 

Measuring both code phase and phase rate (doppler) at at last channel specific tracking epoch by the tracking loop allows us to project all measurements forward in time to an agreed "measurement epoch". 

The receiver then forms the [[Ranges]] for the user.
