1. Orbits are ellipses with a star or planet at one of the two foci
2. The line joining the focus to the satellite will sweep equal area in equal time

## For earth
When applied to the [[Earth orbit]], the laws become

1. The satellite is a conical section, i.e. an ellipse, parabola or hyperbola with the gravitational center of the Earth at one of the foci
2. The vector from the center of gravity of Earth to the center of gravity of the satellite sweeps over equal areas in equal time
3. If the satellite has an elliptic orbit, the square of the orbit time is proportional to the length of the semi-major axis raised to the third power
