## Orbits
Using [[Keplers laws]] and the assumptions of point masses we get the ideal satellite orbits. Do note that the moon affects the orbits, and the earth's flattening is the main reason for an inclined satellite not following an ideal orbit.

In GPS this error is modelled as harmonics (sinusoidal) applied to all three dimensions expressed radially across track and along track. This information is broadcast with the [[Ephemeris]] so we can account for deviations from the ideal orbit.
