## Definitions

Apogee: The highest point in an orbit
Perogee: The lowest point in an orbit
a: semimajor axis
b: semiminor axis
e: eccentricity (how squished the ellipse)
v: true anomaly at epoch (i.e. angle from perigee to position given a point in time)
$\tau$: time of perigee passage

## Anomaly

#### Mean
The **mean** anomaly is a non-geometrical quantity, the angle between the perigee and an imaginary satellite in a circular orbit with the same semimajor axis and period as the satellite of interest, but moving with const speed.

The constant speed is the mean motion of the satellite.

The mean anomaly varies linearly with time:

#### Eccentric
The eccentric anomaly is calculated as
