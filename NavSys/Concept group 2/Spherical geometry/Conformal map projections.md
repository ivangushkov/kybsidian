## TLDR
A conformal map preserves angles. Thus an angle between two points on the reference ellipsoid will be the same in the map projection, so a navigator can therefore determine the course between two points in the map and travel that same course on the reference ellipsoid.


## Notes
A geodesic (part of a great circle) represents the shortest path between two points on a curved surface. 

The projection of a geodesic in a conformal map projection will in general be a curved line with the concave side facing the central meridian of the projection.

In the case of the [[Mercator projection]]  the central meridian is the Equator.
