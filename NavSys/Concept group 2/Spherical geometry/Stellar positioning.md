## Concept

The elevation angle of a star gives us a circle of position where we must be. By measuring two stars we can find the circular overlaps to find 2 (or 1) potential solutions. Resolving this ambiguity can be done with three stars or reasonable priors.

Note that since the earth is rotating, accurate timekeeping is required for this! 1 minute of time error translates to 28km of position error at the equator. 

Also note that f.ex the North celestial pole is visible as a "stable pole", and so measuring the angle between the horizon and the stable pole, we can resolve latitude without timekeeping. Longitude is however only available with timekeeping
