O is the sphere origin, A and B are points, theta is the angle between AOB. Note that the arc length between A and B is R\*theta. That is to say:

		Angles and distances are equivalents in spherical geometry.

"Lines" in euclidean geometry are also different.

		Lines in euclidean geometry are great circles in spherical 
        geometry.
