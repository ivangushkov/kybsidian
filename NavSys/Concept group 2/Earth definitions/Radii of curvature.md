## Example

Moving along the solid ellipsoid is a side view of changing latitude, and a part of this is the [[Meridian]] in question. M is the radius of the circle that has the same curvature of the ellipse at a given point, while N would be the radius of the circle that fits inside the ellipse that would bend out of the screen (or into the screen) normal to the drawn ellipse.
