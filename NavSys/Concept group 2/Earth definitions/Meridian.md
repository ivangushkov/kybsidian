## Notes
The radius of curvature of a meridian on an idealized spherical earth would be constant

Since earth is an oblate spheroid the radius of curvature varies continuously with latitude.

Note that since the meridian is half of a great circle, the equator above is **not** a meridian, but instead a great circle. Half of the equator would be a meridian
