## Definition
A course that intersects all [[Meridian]]s at the same angle. This path will not be a geodetic line, i.e.

		Course of constant heading

This in general not be the shortest path - only when following a pure north/south course.

Using a perfect compass with an accurate declination map, this is the path we would follow if we held a constant compass value.
