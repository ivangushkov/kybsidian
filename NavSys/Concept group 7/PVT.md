## Position, Velocity, Time

Standard state vector: X = x y z vx vy vz $\Delta t$ $\dot{\Delta t}$

For a user moving with some velocity, a doppler shift will be introduced. Integrating this leads to [[Delta range]].

To add this to the normal GNSS [[State space]], we expand the H matrix to include LOS velocity. Simplifications here can be made (i.e. exclude near-zero terms)
