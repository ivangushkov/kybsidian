## Notes
The mass of the earth is not evenly distributed, which leads to gravitational potential differences across the globe.

Geoid height - also seen as "sea level" - varies nearly 200m over the earth.

This also means that "straight down" i.e. the gravitational vector, is affected by local topology. The local gravity vs the global mean can vary with over a degree. Although we can usually ignore this, surveyors or accurate navigators cannot ignore this.

		The vector that a pendulum would hang along is called the "Plumb 
        line"
