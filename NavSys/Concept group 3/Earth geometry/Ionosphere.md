## Structure

Divided in layers.
Charge is created by energy from the sun ionizing the atmosphere.
Denser in the day usually
At night it drifts to a higher altitude


## Ionospheric effects
Signals below several (~12) MHz will "bounce off".

It is a dispersive medium, meaning that signals of different frequencies will be **delayed** different amounts.

Northern lights often appear when the ionosphere is very active and unstable, i.e. that the ionosphere is changing very rapidly - **ionospheric scintellation**. The problem can manifest in [[Range accuracy]] by having two signals be offset by 180 degrees, thus cancelling out at the receiver. This will very often cause the receiver to lose lock on the signal since the loss of signal usually also makes the phase jump 90 degrees, but this rarely happens to more than 3-4 satellites simultaneously.
