## Different systems

1. Ellipsoidal height
2. Geoide height / mean sea level
3. Orthometric height
4. Barometric height
5. Radar altimeter

## 1
Height of the local terrain as measured from the smooth ellipsoid model of earth from [[WGS84]]

## 2
Takes into account gravitational potential over the planet. Note that the sea follows this height due to differences in potential (the geoid)

## 3
Difference between the ellipsoid and the geoid height, i.e. the terrain height as measured from the [[Geoid]]

## 4
Pressure altitude, varies with local pressure and climactic condition. This bias is not a problem as long as everyone in the local area is using the same system.

## 5
Directly measures height over local terrain and obstacles - totally separate from what GPS reports
