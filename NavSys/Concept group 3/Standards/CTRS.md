## Conventional Terrestrial Reference System

Origin at the earths center of mass

z through the Conventional Terrestrial Pole (CTP)
x through the intersection of CTPs equatorial plane and a reference meridian\*
y completes a right hand system.

\*This definition is abstract, and so as a reference system it is usually realized by adopting the coordinates of a set of points, i.e. the prime meridian.

## Notes
There exists many different realizations of the CTRS, called reference frames. A realization central to GPS is [[WGS84]]

CTRS also needs a reference epoch, i.e. a point in time that the frame is referenced to. The reference epoch can be brought forwards in time, and as long as two references can be expressed as a cont. function of time, it is possible to transform between coordinate frames with different epochs. The most recent [[WGS84]] is [[ITRF]] 2000.
