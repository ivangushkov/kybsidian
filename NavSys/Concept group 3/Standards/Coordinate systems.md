## ECEF
Origin at the center of the planet, z axis points outwards through the north pole, x axis is aligned to the prime meridian and y completes RHS.

		ECEF rotates with earth and is thus not an inertial frame

However, the unit is in meters, which is nice.

## Local tangent plane
Presents coordinates in cartesian meters. ENU, NED, NEU.

The origin moves with the user, as well as the angle of the plane.
		
		Very useful in the local frame, but is not a global frame.

## LLH
Longitude, Latitude, Height.


## BODY
The user or vehicle.  Uses euler angles in [[Rotation]]
