## International Terrestrial Reference Frame

A more accurate realization of [[CTRS]] defined by the scientific community. All precise orbits and clock products from the International GNSS Service are related to the current ITRF realization.

ITRF is mainly a tool for research and will thus be changed and adapted to needs of the scientific community. This means that it does not provide the simplicity and unification powers of [[WGS84]], so even though ITRF is more accurate, it will not be adopted by everyone.
