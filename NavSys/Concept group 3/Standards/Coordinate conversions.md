## Concept
To utilize the different [[Coordinate conversions]], we may want to convert between them.

		ECEF is equivalent to "cartesian point"

## LLH to ECEF
$\phi$ is lat, $\lambda$ is lon, and h is height. xyz is resolved in ECEF. Note that lat is limited to $\pm$ 90$\degree$ while lon is limited to $\pm$ 180$\degree$
