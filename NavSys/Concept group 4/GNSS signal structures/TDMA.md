Each user waits for one another to get access. I.e. one user talks at a time.

Not feasible since the dynamic range (i.e. variance in distance from user) of sats is huge, 

Time division multiple access, i.e. use different time of arrival for one user to separate between satellites. **This will almost always line up for *some* users**, meaning that is it useless for long distances and dynamic ranges (satellites move up and down in height form earth). Used in LORAN because these are not problems here.
