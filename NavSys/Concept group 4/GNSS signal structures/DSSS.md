## Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum

By multiplying a narrowband signal in the time domain, the signal energy is spread out in frequency domain.

This happens since the chipping signal is a square wave, and this turns into a sinc wave in frequency domain: The raw sinusoid would be a dirac at the given frequency, i.e. all the energy would be at that freq.
