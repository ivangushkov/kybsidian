## About
Code division multiple access. Lets multiple satellites be in view of multiple users without individual signals interfering with one another.

Each satellite has its own unique code sequence. These are designed to have very low off peak autocorrelation and very low cross [[correlation]] between codes.

## GPS
Uses the "Gold Codes" which are codes that have very low cross [[correlation]].
Over all doppler offsets, code cross correlation is lower than -21dB.

The main peak of a satellite will be over 100x above this, compared to another satellite at the same power level.
