Different radionav have sued very different frequency band.

Wavelength from v = $f*\lambda$ and the speed of light. and is the amount of space a wave takes in the 3D world.

To design an antenna you need it to cover a substancial part of the wavelength to have any power. (ex wavelength / 4)

Ex: f = 16.4 kHz and using the speed of light we get 18.3km wavelength - designing an antenna for this not fun


## Propagation

Skipping means that the wave can travel further than just the ground wave.

Problematic when you get multiple copies. 

[[LORAN]] uses 3rd zero crossing to avoid ambiguities.

Since the [[Ionosphere]] moves up during the night, the sky wave can travel further away at night.

## In GNSS
Not ideal for GNSS since lower freq requires larger antennas in the [[Space segment]]. Also see **4** in [[GNSS problems]].

We refer to signals we are using as **space waves** which are above 30MHz and are approximated to move in straight lines through the [[Ionosphere]].
