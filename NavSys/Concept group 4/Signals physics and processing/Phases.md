The phase of the signal is degraded in a similar way to the [[Ranges]]:

Note the negative alpha f: The phase is advanced by the ionosphere. The data is not since we cannot send information faster than light.

NL is the integer number of cycles of the carrier between the user and the satellite - this ambiguity cannot be measured - if it could we would have cm-accuracy in gps. High end receivers put a lot into estimating this.

w is a "windup" term.
