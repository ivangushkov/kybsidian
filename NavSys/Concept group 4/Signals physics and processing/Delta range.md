Once the PRN code has been acquired we need to find the phase of the signal, which can be interpreted as the residual phase of the signal plus an unknown integer number of cycles between the user and the satellite.

This can also be viewed as a fractional phase plus an integral of the doppler between the user and sattelite, thus the name "accumulated delta range"
