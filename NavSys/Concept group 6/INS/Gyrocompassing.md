Requires low noise [[Gyroscope]]s to achieve.

## Concept
Determine North using gyroscopes

As time passes, the rate of rotation changes by the rotation of the earth. From this, North is observable.

With a full sensor array the accelerometers can inform us which way is down. This makes latitude observable.

Longitude is not observable, but high end [[INS]] can estimate this
