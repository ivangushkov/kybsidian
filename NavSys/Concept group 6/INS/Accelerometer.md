Measure reaction of a deformable body


## MEMS

Micro-eletro-mechanical systems.

Applied [[Forces]] makes a membrane move, measure the differential capacitance.

Capacitance is proportional to deflection. Deflection is proportional to acceleration.

Need multiple to measure force in 3 DOF. Multiple also us
