Cheaper ones use a spinning mass. When the outer structure moves (change of orientation, the inner structure would tend to resist the change, i.e. staying fixed in place. 

Strapdown: the platform doesnt move, but instead gives out measurements


Higher quality: Optical gyro. Send light clockwise and counter clockwise: rotation will alter the apparent distance for the light. Since the speed of light is constant, the light will reach the end of the coils out of phase. Thus: rotation rate is proportional to the phase shift. This effect is called [[Sagnac interference]]
