[[INS Bias]] can be somewhat calibrated out


## 6 position calibration

Orient the [[INS]] system sequentially plus and minus XYZ.

Each position gives measurements from [[Accelerometer]] and [[Gyroscope]].
By inverting and measuring again on the same axis we can separate the bias and scale factor.
