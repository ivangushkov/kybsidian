Can be ensured with redundancy either with duplication or triplication.

Duplication: if both sensors do not agree, retry.
Triplication: voting based.

A fourth sensor can be added in [[INS]] in a non-parallel configuration to detect instrument malfunction, and a fifth to isolate which sensor failed.
