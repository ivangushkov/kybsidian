Desired to use over [[Gyroscope]]s since gyro rate is the biggest contributor to error. 

Principle: Use a 3 dimensional model of the earths magnetic field to determine our 3 dimensional orientation.

## Note
True North depends on magnetic declination, i.e. that the north pole is not the North Pole!

Also, readings will depend on tilt, and tilt compensation can greatly improve estimates.

Magnetometers are also greatly affected by hard/soft iron, which tends to be in places where we would want to use magnetometers (ex. inside)


	Magnetometers are great, except for when you need them
