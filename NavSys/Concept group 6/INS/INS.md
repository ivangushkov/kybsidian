## Inertial Navigation Systems
Concept: Measure the change in state for a system.

## Types:

* ISA: inertial sensor assembly. 2 or n [[Accelerometer]]s and/or [[Gyroscope]]
* IMU: full triad of [[Accelerometer]]s and [[Gyroscope]]
* INS: IMU plus processing, converts data into parameters such as rotation and velocity updates
* AHRS: INS that only outputs attitude and heading. Useful for artificial horizon

## I-frame
Inertial frame that INS will measure relative to.

In a rotating frames there are ficticious forces that must be introduced to predict apparent motion.

1. Coriolos effect - as lateral motion in objects that move north/south
2. Centrifugal force - Appears as variations in gravity over the surface of earth (objects slightly heavier at the poles)
3.
