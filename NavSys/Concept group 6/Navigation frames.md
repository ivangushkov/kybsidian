[[INS]] frames:

1. The inertial sensors output in the sensor frame
2. The body frame is defined by the platform/vessel the [[INS]] is mounted on.
3. The local navigation frame has its origin in 2. but differs in rotation.

The body usually uses the NED convention.


## Rotations

[[Rotation]] follows many conventions.
