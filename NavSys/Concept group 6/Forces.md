[[Accelerometer]]s measure Reaction force!!

Free fall will be measured as zero acceleration.

The standard process for dealing with this is to calculate the expected force from gravity at our current location if we were static - and remove it. This is referred to as the gravity model, and includes centrifugal forces.

	The total force acting on the platform is the specific force.
