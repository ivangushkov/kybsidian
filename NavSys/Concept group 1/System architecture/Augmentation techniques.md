## Concept
By utilizing certain techniques, part of the uncertainty in the GNSS signals can be removed, thus improving solution accuracy. These techniques involve:

* [[DGNSS]]
* [[WAAS]]
* [[EGNOS]]
* [[GBAS]]
* [[RTK]]
* [[PPP]]

[[WAAS]], [[EGNOS]] and [[GBAS]] also provide greater **integrity** which is highly important in safety critical operations.
