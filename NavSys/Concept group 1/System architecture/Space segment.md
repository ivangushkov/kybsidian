Feedback loop with [[Control segment]]

Contains the satellites

Distributed over 6 orbital planes, optimized to get direct overhead satellites at a large area as possible.

Different type of "Blocks" i.e. versions


### Mission

Point to earth
Transmit navigation signals to ground
Accept commands from [[Control segment]]

### Build

3 axis stabilizing.  "Nadir pointing" i.e. towards earth

Solar panels for power and batteries for storage:
At higher latitudes we get less power per m^2 since the same amount of solar flux is spread over a larger area as earth slopes away.

## Antennas

Oriented to beam form the signals to send as much energy towards earth and only earth as possible

## Constellations
Different constellations have different clock bias relative to one another. If we use N satellites from one constellation, adding one constellation to the user in the [[User segment]] will not improve position estimates, since all the information in this new satellite will go to resolving clock bias differences.
