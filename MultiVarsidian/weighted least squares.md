## Weighted Least Squares

#### Basic Assumptions

- Heteroschedasticity of noise - the noise is assumed to change statistical properties with time and we wish to have a method which can robustify the LS approach against insane realizations of the noise.

#### Geometric Intuition
Now we consider the case of heteroschedastic noise.

FIGURE

We want to weight the faulty measurement a lot less than the other one. 

#### Mathematical Formulation
Weighted Normal Equations.
