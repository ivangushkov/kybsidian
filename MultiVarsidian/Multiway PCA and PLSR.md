ooooh shieeet no time for this boi :)

But N-way PCA is a thing, and basically it extracts lower dimensional 3-way linear structures from the data. This is connected to tensors. Great results in reconstructing the signals in lower dimensions. PARAFAC (TCA) and Tucker3 algorithms exist. PARAFAC is basically unfolding the data succesively and fitting least squares to find the remaining folds (fuck me if I know what that means..)

We can also do regression with N way PLSR, look at slides for maf :)
